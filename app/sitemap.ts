 * Every indexable page.

 * The product catalogue, the author profiles and the paginated /articles/ pages
 * were all absent: the sitemap listed 67 URLs against 298 built pages, so 215
 * product pages had no path in it at all and relied on being found by crawl
 * alone.
 *
 * The paginated /articles/page/N/ listings were taken back out (AdSense Task
 * 10, 24 Sep 2026): they are ~230-word card grids, not destinations, and stay
 * reachable through /articles/ pagination. Page one, /articles/, stays.
 *
 * /search/, /preview/ and /design-preview/ stay out — robots.txt disallows them,
 * and a sitemap that lists a disallowed URL is a contradiction Search Console
 * reports back.
