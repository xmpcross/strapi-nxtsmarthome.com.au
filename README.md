# nxtsmarthome.com.au

Smart home blog for the Australian market. A Next.js server (`next start`) with
Strapi-backed editorial content, a local product catalogue, nginx in front,
affiliate tracking, consent handling, analytics and advertising.

Since 24 Sep 2026 production runs as a Node server, like bestlooking.skin and
originfacts.com: `nxtsmarthome-com-au.service` on `127.0.0.1:3013`, behind
nginx and Cloudflare. Posts and listings refresh from Strapi by ISR every 5
minutes and the sitemap hourly, so publishing a post in Strapi needs no deploy.

**Source of truth is split deliberately:**

- Strapi is the source of truth for published posts, author bylines, uploaded post
  covers, the CMS navigation menu and CMS-managed article metadata.
- This repository is the source of truth for the Next.js app, design system,
  product catalogue, affiliate/rendering logic, redirects, nginx config and
  deployment scripts.
- `content/articles/` is retained as history and migration source. The live site
  does not read it.

Editorial rules (what may be claimed, how products are placed) live in
`CLAUDE.md`. Read that before writing content; this file covers the mechanics.

## Quick reference

```bash
cd /opt/projects/nxtsmarthome.com.au
nvm use 22

npm run dev                # local dev on http://localhost:3011
npm run build              # prebuild + next build (production server build)
./deploy.sh                # production: build aside, swap in, restart, IndexNow
                           # (npm run deploy runs the same script)
npm run deploy:preview     # build/publish preview target
npm run seed:menu          # seed/update Strapi navigation menu
npm run new:article -- "Title" <category> <type> [--author=slug]
npm run audit:thin         # thin-content audit -> reports/thin-content-audit.csv
npm run audit:content      # per-post [VERIFY]/placeholder/duplicate report
```

Node 22 is required (`.nvmrc` pins it). The system Node on the server is v26, so
run `nvm use 22` first.

Always use `npm run build`, never `npx next build`; the npm lifecycle is part of
the product. `prebuild` creates the search index, redirect/header files, nav cache
and author cache. GA4 and Geniuslink are rendered into `<head>` by
`components/HeadScripts.tsx`; their inline code is in `public/js/`.

## Content source

Published articles come from Strapi via `lib/strapi.ts` and are adapted in
`lib/content.ts` into the same shape the old markdown loader returned. Components
still consume `Article` objects, but the source is now:

```text
Strapi nxtsmarthome-posts  ->  lib/strapi.ts  ->  lib/content.ts  ->  next start (ISR, 5 min)
```

The build asks Strapi for `status=published`, populates categories, author,
cover image and FAQ, and appends a per-build cache buster to the CMS query so a
freshly uploaded cover is not hidden by Next's fetch cache.

Uploaded Strapi media wins over `coverImageUrl`. If no CMS image exists, the site
falls back to generated covers under `public/covers/` and square thumbnails under
`public/covers/square/`.

### Writing or editing an article

Use Strapi for live content. Set these fields there:

| CMS field | Site use |
|---|---|
| `title` | Article title, cards and metadata |
| `slug` | Article URL slug |
| `excerpt` | Meta description and card text |
| `content` | Markdown body rendered by the site |
| `postType` | Mapped to the site's article type labels |
| `publishDate` | Primary sort and display date |
| `dateModified` | Optional updated date |
| `categories` | First category maps to the site category key |
| `author` | Byline, resolved against cached authors |
| `coverImage` | Preferred cover image media |
| `coverImageUrl` | Fallback image URL only |
| `coverImageAlt` | Cover alt text fallback |
| `keyTakeaways` | "The short answer" callout |
| `tags` | Related-article scoring and search facets |
| `faq` | FAQ accordion and FAQ structured data |
| `featured` | Home page feature placement |

Strapi and the site use slightly different article type vocabularies. The mapping
lives in `lib/strapi.ts`:

| Strapi `postType` | Site type |
|---|---|
| `how-to-guide` | `how-to` |
| `product-comparison` | `comparison` |
| `product-roundup` | `roundup` |
| `informative` | `explainer` |
| `buying-guide` | `buying-guide` |
| `pillar` | `pillar` |
| `review` | `review` |

`npm run new:article` still scaffolds a markdown file, with optional
`--author=<slug>`, but that file is not published by the site. Treat it as a draft
or migration helper unless you later import it into Strapi.

### Categories

`security`, `lighting`, `energy`, `entertainment`, `climate`,
`hubs-and-platforms`, `robot-vacuums`, `setup-guides`, `buying-guides`

Defined in `lib/site.ts`. Frontend routes, category pages, counts and sitemap
entries use the category metadata there. Strapi categories are matched by slug or
key and translated back to the site category key.

### Products in articles

Products are still referenced inside the markdown body:

```markdown
::product:aqara-hub-m3::
```

`components/ArticleBody.tsx` swaps each marker for a `ProductBox` using the local
catalogue. Every article that recommends products should discuss them genuinely,
with a verdict and a category match. `CLAUDE.md` rule 8 is the authority.

```bash
node scripts/link-products.mjs <slug>            # preview placements
node scripts/link-products.mjs <slug> --write    # apply them to markdown drafts
```

The placement script is useful for markdown drafts and migration work. Live CMS
articles must still be updated in Strapi.

## Content audits

Two read-only audits, both built from source data (Strapi plus the repo), not
the live site, so they can be re-run after every fix. Neither writes to Strapi.

```bash
npm run audit:thin         # every article, product and author page with a verdict
npm run audit:content      # per-post report; add -- --json for machine output
```

`npm run audit:thin` runs `scripts/audit-thin-content.mjs` (with `.env.local`
loaded if present) and writes **`reports/thin-content-audit.csv`**, one row per
page:

- **Columns:** `type`, `url`, `slug`, `title`, `category`, `verdict`, `action`,
  `indexable`, `body_words`, `faq_words`, `original_words`, `h2_count`,
  `visible_verify`, `verify_total`, `placeholders`, `posts`, `duplicate_of`
  and `flags`.
- **It prints** a summary by type and verdict, near-duplicate article pairs,
  merged-away slugs still published in Strapi, and `INDEXABLE THIN PAGES: n`.
- **Exit code 1** when any *indexable* page is DUPLICATE, FIX, OFF-TOPIC or
  THIN - EMPTY, so it can gate a deploy.

| Type | Verdicts |
|---|---|
| Article | DUPLICATE (merged away but still published, or a near-duplicate pair where both halves are live: title-token Jaccard ≥ 0.5 or 5-word-shingle body Jaccard ≥ 0.30) · FIX (visible `[VERIFY]` notes or template placeholders) · BORDERLINE (under 800 body words) · OK |
| Product | OFF-TOPIC (not smart home, e.g. woodworking routers) · THIN - EMPTY (under 50 original words) · THIN (under 300, or missing bestFor/pros/cons) · OK |
| Author | THIN (no live posts, or a profile under 150 words) · OK |

"Indexable" mirrors the site's own rules, so the gate checks what Google can
see:
- **Articles:** `lib/editorial-guard.mjs` and `data/merged-articles.json`.
- **Products:** `productEditorial()` in `lib/products.ts`, replicated in the
  script because that file is TypeScript. Change both together.
- **Authors:** at least one live post.

`npm run audit:content` (`scripts/audit-content.mjs`) is the narrower per-post
report used for the AdSense work: word count, `[VERIFY]` and placeholder hits,
publishDate against createdAt (backdated posts) and duplicate clusters. The
background and the latest counts are in `ADSENSE_CHANGES.md`.

## Product catalogue

```text
public/data/products.json     205 products — the catalogue behind /products/ and ProductBox
content/products/*.md         curated overrides, hand-written
```

Products are sourced through DataForSEO and eBay, enriched with images, reviews
and retailer prices, then pruned. The pipeline lives in `scripts/` and runs
locally, never at build time:

```bash
npm run fetch:products:dry     # what would change
npm run fetch:products         # fetch and write
node scripts/prune-fabricated-products.mjs
node scripts/generate-cover.mjs <slug>     # fal.ai cover art, where available
```

The site itself still builds product pages from `public/data/products.json`, not
from Strapi commerce products.

### Strapi product import

`scripts/strapi-import-products.mjs` imports the local catalogue into shared
Strapi commerce types:

```bash
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/strapi-import-products.mjs --dry-run
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/strapi-import-products.mjs
```

This is a one-way catalogue push. It scopes imported products to the
`nxtsmarthome.com.au` commerce site, matches on product slug plus site, and
suffixes slug collisions rather than overwriting another catalogue's product.
Categories, brands and merchants are shared taxonomy; products and offers are
site-scoped.

## Affiliate, analytics and ads

Outbound merchant links are left as plain retailer URLs: `affiliateUrl()` in
`lib/affiliate.ts` returns them unchanged. `scripts/inject-geniuslink.mjs`
(`postbuild`) then adds the Geniuslink snippet to every exported page, and the
snippet affiliates and localises supported merchants in the browser. Put the raw
merchant URL in a product's `retailers[].url`, and do not paste pre-built
affiliate links into content.

Sovrn, and the per-network IDs for Amazon, eBay, Walmart and CJ, are no longer
used.

Useful environment variables:

```text
NEXT_PUBLIC_GENIUSLINK_TSID               Geniuslink TSID (numeric); unset = no snippet, no affiliation
NEXT_PUBLIC_GENIUSLINK_BASE_URL           default https://buy.geni.us
NEXT_PUBLIC_GENIUSLINK_PRESERVE_EXISTING  keep links that are already affiliated
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID             GA4 ID (also hard-coded in scripts/inject-ga.mjs)
STRAPI_URL                                CMS base URL, defaults in code
STRAPI_TOKEN / STRAPI_API_TOKEN           CMS API token
```

Form mail (the contact service on the server, Pages Functions on Pages):

```text
SMTP_HOST / SMTP_PORT            Stalwart, default mail.fxnstudio.com:465
SMTP_USER / SMTP_PASS            Stalwart account the forms send as (secret)
CONTACT_TO / CONTACT_FROM        recipient / sender (sender defaults to SMTP_USER)
CONTACT_ORIGIN                   CORS origin, default https://nxtsmarthome.com.au
```

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are read at build time and baked into the build, so run
`./deploy.sh` after changing them in `.env.local`.

### Consent and advertising

The cookie banner gates Google Analytics:

- GA4 is injected with Consent Mode v2 defaults set to denied until accepted.
- The Geniuslink snippet is not gated by the banner: it loads on every page.
- No ads: Google AdSense and the SearchAtlas (OTTO) script were removed on
  24 Sep 2026. Monetisation is Geniuslink and Sovrn Commerce only.

`/cookies` should stay in sync with the actual scripts. It no longer claims that
no analytics is present.

## Design: Ncmaz template

Since 24 Sep 2026 the site uses the **Ncmaz** blog/magazine template (Next.js,
Tailwind 4, Headless UI; source zip in `/opt/projects/assets/templates/`). The
template's code was merged in rather than used as a new base, so URLs, SEO,
Strapi data, products and affiliate scripts are unchanged.

- `components/` holds the template's sections and cards (`SectionMagazine*`,
  `PostCards/Card*`, `Widget*`, `Header/`, `Footer/`) alongside the site's own
  components (`ArticleBody`, `ProductBox`, `Faq`, `Comments`, ...).
  `shared/` holds its UI primitives, and `hooks/`, `utils/` and `images/` its
  helpers.
- `data/` is the adapter layer. It exposes the template's data API
  (`getAllPosts`, `TPost`, `getCategories`, `getNavigation`, ...) built from
  `lib/content.ts` (Strapi), `lib/site.ts` and `lib/authors.ts`.
  - A post's `handle` is its canonical path without the leading slash, so
    template links (`/${handle}`) land on real article URLs.
  - Template links were rewritten: `/post/*` to the article URL, `/category/*`
    to `/categories/*/`, and `/author/*` to `/authors/*/`.
- `app/globals.css` is the template's Tailwind 4 theme, with primary = the
  brand purple. Styles kept from the previous theme follow it. The font is
  Be Vietnam Pro, via `next/font`.
- Removed from the template, because they have no backing: likes and comment
  counts, follow/report/hide actions, login and dashboard, and audio, video
  and gallery posts.
- Section headings are `h2`; each page has exactly one `h1`.

```

## URLs and redirects

Articles live at `/<category-slug>/<article-slug>/`. The site category key can
be different from the URL slug; `lib/site.ts` holds the mapping.

Legacy article URLs used `/articles/<slug>/`. `scripts/gen-redirects.mjs` writes
the 301s in every host format on `prebuild`:

```text
public/_redirects        Cloudflare Pages / Workers / Netlify format
public/_headers          security and cache headers for the same hosts
public/_redirects.map    the same 301s as an nginx map
```

nginx includes `public/_redirects.map` straight from this checkout, and
`deploy.sh` reloads nginx after each build. The redirect rules stay in the
repository and portable across hosts. nginx returns 404 for
`/_redirects*` and `/_headers`, so they are never served.

Trailing slashes are canonical. Internal links should use `/articles/foo/`, not
`/articles/foo`.

## Deployment

Production runs on this server (**51.161.208.188**) from this checkout. Work on
`master`; pushing does not publish anything.

```bash
cd /opt/projects/nxtsmarthome.com.au
./deploy.sh                # build the working tree, swap it in, restart
./deploy.sh --pull         # git pull --ff-only first
./deploy.sh --allow-dirty  # build with uncommitted changes (refuses otherwise)
```

| Piece | Where |
| --- | --- |
| App | `nxtsmarthome-com-au.service`: `next start -H 127.0.0.1 -p 3013`, Node 22 (nvm), env from `.env.local`, log `/var/log/nxtsmarthome-com-au.log`. Unit file: `deploy/systemd/` |
| nginx | `deploy/nginx/sites-available/nxtsmarthome.com.au` + `snippets/nxtsmarthome-site.conf`: TLS, www → apex, 301 map, `/api/*` to the contact service, `/preview/`, everything else proxied to 3013 |
| 301 map | `public/_redirects.map`, generated by `prebuild`, included by nginx; `deploy.sh` reloads nginx |
| Forms | `nxtsmarthome-contact.service` on 4320 (below) |
| TLS | Let's Encrypt, webroot renewal via `/var/www/certbot-webroot`; Cloudflare SSL mode Full (strict) |

What `deploy.sh` does:
- Builds into `.next-build` while the live server keeps serving `.next`.
- Only after a successful build does it stop the service, swap the directories
  and start again. Downtime is a few seconds, and a failed build never touches
  the live site.
- Checks the home page and that every stylesheet it links returns 200. If not,
  it rolls back to the previous build.
- Reloads nginx for the redirect map.
- Submits to IndexNow the sitemap URLs that are new or whose `lastmod` changed.

When a change needs a deploy:
- **Strapi posts, authors and listings** do not; they refresh within 5 minutes.
- **Code, the product catalogue, covers in `public/`, the nav cache and the
  search index** do; they change only with a build.

Hosting history:
- A static export on nginx until 24 Sep 2026.
- Cloudflare Pages/Workers, briefly, the same day. It was switched off because
  the form Functions never ran there and the Geniuslink TSID was missing.
  [`CLOUDFLARE_PAGES.md`](CLOUDFLARE_PAGES.md) is kept for reference.

The draft preview (`npm run deploy:preview`) is still a static export. It is
published to `/var/www/nxtsmarthome-preview/preview` and served at `/preview/`
with `noindex`.

### Contact and comment forms

The contact form posts to `/api/contact`, and article comments post to
`/api/comment`. On the server, nginx proxies both paths to
`nxtsmarthome-contact.service` (`/opt/nxtsmarthome-contact/server.mjs`,
`127.0.0.1:4320`). The service is not in this repo.

Its SMTP settings are read from **this project's `.env.local`**: `SMTP_HOST`,
`SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASS`, `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL`, `CONTACT_FROM_EMAIL`.
A systemd drop-in loads them
(`/etc/systemd/system/nxtsmarthome-contact.service.d/project-env.conf`); the
service's own `/opt/nxtsmarthome-contact/.env` holds only the defaults. After
editing `.env.local`, run `systemctl restart nxtsmarthome-contact`.

Mail goes through the FXN **Stalwart** server (`mail.fxnstudio.com:465`) using
`SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS`. Brevo was removed on 24 Sep 2026. Stalwart rejects a
sender the account does not own, so the sender defaults to `SMTP_USER`.
Messages go to `CONTACT_TO_EMAIL` (`contact@nxtsmarthome.com.au`), with Reply-To
set to the reader.

Checks:
- A honeypot field (`company`) catches bots.
- A submission sent less than 2 seconds after the form loaded is dropped.
- Bot submissions get a 200 response, so a bot learns nothing.
- Each IP address can send 5 messages per 10 minutes.

When delivery fails, the reader gets a 502 that asks them to email
`CONTACT_TO` directly. Check with
`journalctl -u nxtsmarthome-contact -n 20`.

For mail sent through Stalwart to pass SPF and DKIM, the domain's DNS needs
`ip4:51.161.208.188` in SPF and Stalwart's DKIM records. MX stays on Google.

### Cloudflare Pages (disabled)

Not in use; production is `npm run deploy` on the server. The repo keeps the
Pages pieces:
- `functions/api/contact.js` and `functions/api/comment.js` do the service's job
  with the same checks, sending with `worker-mailer`.
- `scripts/pages-build.sh` is the build command. It refuses to run without the
  Strapi and affiliate variables, and refuses to publish an incomplete export.

Settings, variables and the switch-over steps are in
[`CLOUDFLARE_PAGES.md`](CLOUDFLARE_PAGES.md). Keep
`functions/_lib/mail-form.js` and the server's `server.mjs` in step.

### The web server

nginx config lives in `deploy/nginx/`, and `scripts/setup-web-server.sh` installs
it. On a bare Ubuntu host it also installs nginx and certbot. Both are idempotent,
so the script is also how a config change reaches the server:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-web-server.sh                  # this machine
bash scripts/setup-web-server.sh root@1.2.3.4     # a new one
```

| Installed path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/etc/nginx/sites-available/nxtsmarthome.com.au` | vhost — server names, TLS, redirect maps |
| `/etc/nginx/snippets/nxtsmarthome-site.conf` | serving rules shared by HTTP and HTTPS blocks |
| `/etc/nginx/conf.d/00-map-hash.conf` | bigger map hash buckets; must parse before any `map` |
| `/etc/nginx/conf.d/10-gzip.conf` | compression beyond Ubuntu's HTML default |
| `/etc/nginx/conf.d/20-cloudflare-real-ip.conf` | restores visitor IPs from Cloudflare headers |
| `/var/www/certbot-webroot` | ACME challenges, outside the deploy-deleted site tree |

### TLS and Cloudflare

The certificate is Let's Encrypt, covering the apex and `www`, issued and
renewed through the webroot at `/var/www/certbot-webroot` by certbot's own timer:

```bash
certbot certonly --webroot -w /var/www/certbot-webroot \
  -d nxtsmarthome.com.au -d www.nxtsmarthome.com.au
certbot renew --dry-run          # check renewal still works
```

That webroot deliberately sits outside the site tree because deploy rsyncs with
`--delete` and would otherwise wipe a challenge mid-renewal. The ACME location is
also matched before the HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect, so validation over plain HTTP
works.

Cloudflare proxies the domain:

- SSL/TLS mode must be **Full (strict)**. Flexible creates redirect loops, and
  without a valid origin certificate Full (strict) yields a 521.
- A deploy does not clear the edge. Purge the Cloudflare cache, or visitors can
  keep seeing the previous build.

Two details in the serving config are load-bearing:

- `try_files` ends in `=404`, never `/404.html`; the latter serves the error page
  with a 200 status and creates soft 404s.
- Requests without a trailing slash get a 301 because `trailingSlash: true` makes
  the slashed form canonical.

## Things worth knowing

- `master` now includes the Strapi-driven content work merged in PR #4 on
  2026-08-23. Before that merge, rebuilding from `master` would not match what
  was deployed.
- Hosting history: Cloudflare Workers/Pages, then nginx on /opt from 23 Aug 2026;
  a brief return to Cloudflare on 24 Sep 2026 was reverted the same day. See
  [`CLOUDFLARE_PAGES.md`](CLOUDFLARE_PAGES.md).
- The contact and comment forms post to `/api/contact` and `/api/comment`. On
  the server, nginx proxies these to `nxtsmarthome-contact.service`
  (`/opt/nxtsmarthome-contact`); on Pages, `functions/api/` handles them. Both
  send through Stalwart SMTP (`mail.fxnstudio.com`). Brevo was removed on
  24 Sep 2026.
- `content/articles/` is not the live article store. Update Strapi for published
  content.
- `.next*/`, `out/`, `public/search-index.json`, `public/_redirects`, `public/_headers` and
  `public/_redirects.map` are build artefacts and are gitignored.
- `scratch/` is gitignored; catalogue backups, API task payloads and unused
  components there should not reach the public repository.
- Anything that must survive a host change belongs in this repo, including
  redirect and header rules in all supported host formats.
- The previous site, an orphaned static export with no source, is archived at
  `/opt/backups/nxtsmarthome.com.au/static-export-archive-20260801.tar.gz` if
  any of its content is ever wanted back.
